# React Portfolio
building my first react application

https://kashane1.github.io/first-react-application/ 

## Process
I copied over some file structure from previous projects to start with a skeleton of code that was more managable. The real work started when I was building out the pages of my portfolio and making all the components reactive. I am semi-satisfied with my finished project. I did put a lot of time into this assignment, but could easily spend 10 more hours and still not feel finished. One's portfolio should really exemplify their skillsets as well as teach the viewer a little about the person. 

## Requirements
1. Built a single-page react application as my own portfolio
2. Page contains a header, section for content, and a footer
3. Header contains my name and navigation with section names of my portfolio
4. The application starts on my About Me page showing a picture of myself and a little bio
5. Still need to put in proper contact me form
6. Resume section will be further developed as well
